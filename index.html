<h1 style="font-size:400%;text-align:center;">My Profile</h1>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Personal Information</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Hello there, my name is Isaac Kozma Kelly (Student ID s3925811) and this is a brief overview of who I am, what’s my background and other fundamental information about me.
  <br>
  <br>
I was born in Melbourne Australia where I have lived most of my life, my parents are African American and Hungarian, a very bizarre mixture but I love the differences in culture as it allowed me to see life from many different perspectives. At home unfortunately I only speak English however I can understand basic Hungarian. An interesting fact about me is that I play American football (Gridiron) which allowed me to gain a scholarship for my last year of high school where I played for Layton Christian Academy in Utah. Before the Covid-19 pandemic I was in line to play college football in California for East Los Angeles college, unfortunately those plans where ruined due to the state America. I am still forever grateful for the experiences I gained because of football as I was able to complete life goals that otherwise would’ve been unattainable. </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interest in IT</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> IT has always interested me, ever since I was young I loved playing games and being on the computer, some of my earliest memories are me at my grandparents playing a pinball game on their PC. When I was younger, I never really thought about how computers worked I only enjoyed what they allowed me to do, however, in the last half decade or so I’ve become more invested on how the devices I use everyday work. This sparked an idea that maybe IT could become my future profession. I feel over the past 18 months my interest of IT increased dramatically as the pandemic gave me a new outlook on life and my future, with football being taken out of my hands as a career I began to consider IT more than ever, this led me to enrol into the Bachelor of IT with RMIT.
  <br>
  <br>
Due to the pandemic, I figured if I was to study it would be best to go with a school that has proven that they can teach online as I’ve heard many horror stories from friends that have been studying online and how unorganised it’s been. From the research I’ve done I found that Latrobe and RMIT where the two best schools when it comes to online studying, they were both on Open Universities as well, I chose RMIT purely because I have known a few friends that have studied there.
  <br>
  <br>
Throughout my studies at RMIT I hope to learn a vast amount, I want to know that when I’m done with this course, I’ll be competent in the workplace and be able to get the job I wanted to. I am more interested in the coding side of IT as I know a couple of people who do that as a profession, and they all rave about it. </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Ideal job</h1>
<br>
  <a href="https://bit.ly/3tFKw7I" target="_blank">Job found on seek</a>

<p style="text-align:center;">The job I feel would be ideal for me is one I found on seek. The role is as a software developer for ANZ, which in my opinion would be a great place to have a career. The job appeals to me because of the role, I know a few software developers and they all rave about it, I also think a company like ANZ is one that would not only have a solid work environment but also a great place to have on a resume. To get this role would not be possible yet as the requirements for this role are quite extensive, you need a minimum of 3 years commercial experience developing software in MS C# .NET, I would also need experience with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and much more! This role is clearly looking for a very skilled and knowledgeable software developer, at this point I am no where close to being an acceptable candidate. I currently only have every basic skills when it comes to IT, I know how to operate all of Microsoft office, I know how to fix basic problems on a computer, I know very little Java and Python apart from that I am not very skilled as of yet. To be qualified for a job like this I know that it would take an immense amount of work, first thing I would need to do is complete this bachelor degree as that would be a great step in the right direction, if possible it would be ideal to have a part time job through University that has a focus on MS #C and HTML5 so I can increase my experience.  </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Personal Profile</h1>
<a href="Page2.html" target="_blank">Job found on seek</a>

<p style="text-align:center;">After completing some online tests in regard to personality, learning styles and creativity I came to find some interesting results. Each one provided information that I agree but also disagree with, the first test I completed was the Myers-Briggs 16 personalities test, this test determined that my personality that of “Protagonist” (ENFJ-A/ENFJ-T) which after reading I do agree with this outcome. The same can be said with the online learning style test I did with educationplanner.org where it described me primarily as a Visual learner, again this result I can agree with. The last test I did which was a creativity test with “testmycreativity.org” was in my opinion incorrect and quite vague which was unfortunate. These tests I feel they can give a general understanding to a person’s psychological process however if you want a more accurate and individual answer then working with a psychologist would be the avenue I would take. The results from these tests to me don’t mean much, its interesting to see however it won’t change how I view myself or how I conduct myself in certain situations.
<br>
<br>
These tests could change my influence my behaviour in a team as they show I have attributes that would help the team. The 16-personality test says that “Protagonist” are born leaders, I have always felt this way in any sport or team I’ve been involved in, I’ve never needed a personality test though to know this as it’s something I’ve always know inside of me. This personality test does back this up which gives me more confidence in my abilities to lead others.
<br>
<br>
When forming a team, I feel that the more diverse our personalities are within it is actually beneficial for the end outcome. I would look for people who are different to me as that will allow us to have strengths in all aspects of whatever task we are delt. Within this team there will be many disagreements however that will help us grow as each person will gain perspective, I feel this option is better than all likeminded people as that will then mean that the thought process of the team will be tunnel visioned and there will be no growth.
</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Project Idea</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Follow the crumbs </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">On every app store there are millions of different apps that provide users with thousands of unique abilities. There are apps for games, dating, bookings, photos, social media, and critiquing restaurants. I found that apps that rate restaurants and food sparked my interest for some reason, this gave me the idea to have my project idea around this.  After much research into these types of apps I found that there is one for nearly every food we consume daily and where to buy it from, every food apart from bread! It may seem simple however there is no app for the available for people who want to know where to buy the best bread!
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Motivation</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;">The motivation behind this idea was that I tried to think of what people consume nearly every day, first thing I thought was coffee, unfortunately there is already an app for that, then I thought about bread as it’s something I eat a lot, and funny enough there was no app that rates bread! This app would be very similar to a few other apps as really at its core it’s a review app like many others, however this one is specifically targeted at rating and reviewing bread. I know many people who love bread even more than me so I feel the idea is one that would be one that others would use often.
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Description</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;">“Follow the crumbs” is the name I came up with for this app and it would work based on the user’s reviews, when the app selected it will open to a screen that gives the users the option to selected where they are and what type of bread they desire. After they enter in their location, the user is then greeted with a map that displays the best breads and where to find them within their searched vicinity.
The bakery displayed would be rated based on each type of bread and their overall rating, for example, if a certain bakery does terrific sourdough (10 out of 10), but it bakes an awful croissant (1 out of 10) then the overall store rating would average out and would most likely not be at the top of the listings. If the user however searches for just sourdough, this same bakery will be displayed as one of the top local place to buy from. The app also allows users to add multiple filters so that their search can be tailormade to what they are looking for. These filters include a “sort by” filter that allows for the user to search for bread in range of cost, rating and even popularity.

<br>
For places to be added to “Follow the Crumbs” each bakery would have to set up an account with their items displayed via the app, this allows for easy reviews and rating of each item from the users. Bakeries would want to add themselves on to the site as it allows for greater publicity and it is absolutely free, if they chose not to add themselves then they would be putting their business at a loss as users are more likely to go to places that are reviewed on “follow the crumbs”. This app provides great potential for small local bakeries that only a small group of people may know about, these are the places of business that would improve the most as buyers will be provided to opportunities that they before were not aware of.
<br>
“Follow the Crumbs” could also be used in conjunction with food delivery apps, this would be done if the user wants bread delivered to them they can easily search on our app what the reviews are for bread, this will then incline the user to buy from a company that is recommended on “Follow the Crumbs”.
<br>
This app implements ideas from other incredibly successful apps such as Zomato which is the top rated and download food review app in the world. Zomato has over twenty-two thousand reviews with an average rating of 4.6 out of 5, there is clearly a demand for apps that are like this and “Follow the crumbs” fills a void that is simple yet valuable. This app could become a staple on every smart phone.
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">Follow the crumbs would be available on all smart phones, therefore a user would need a smartphone to access the app, possibly in the future the app could also expand to becoming available on computers. The software needed to create this app would need to work on both android and iOS, this does bring up a few difficulties as the two operating systems use different programming languages. iOS programming language is Swift 4 or Objective-C where Android uses Java or Kotlin, I would suggest we begin on one app and then transition to the next, from what I’ve found is that doing this is the best approach as it allows your app to at least be available on one platform and gain traction. I have also found its apparently easier to accomplish then try to do both at once!
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Skills Required</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">Researching on how apps that are similar to “Follow the crumbs” I found that it is not that easy, and a few skills are needed to make this app. Firstly, to even begin the developers would have to have knowledge with a programming language, be familiar to mobile programming interfaces, know how to implement the use of cross platforming interfaces and know how to implement security on the app. These skills are not learnt overnight and to develop this app would take time. It is feasible to learn these skills, however it would take time. We would also need a great marketing strategy, there are millions of app therefore it is not easy to stand out. We would need to advertise extensively so users can see what the app provides, nobody will download it unless they know about it!
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Outcome</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">Once “follow the crumbs” is realised I honestly believe that it would fill a missing aspect in the app community, this app even though it wouldn’t change the world it would add a great tool for business and consumers. I can see people from all around the world using this app as bread is a product people consume every day, it doesn’t matter if the user is in Australia, Japan, USA or Europe, the app is just as relevant anywhere around the world. As previous mentioned I believe this app would become a staple of most people’s phone, it’s a benefit for every single person that would use it and its honestly built so small business have a chance to shine when they otherwise would be forgotten about.
